# Caesar-Cipher-Encryption-Decryption-Tool
# Overview
This is a Java-based tool that implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm for encrypting and decrypting messages. The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

# Features
✅ Encrypts plaintext using the Caesar Cipher algorithm
✅ Decrypts ciphertext back to plaintext
✅ Allows users to specify a custom shift key
✅ Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters
✅ Ignores non-alphabetic characters for better usability

# How It Works
The user inputs a message and a shift key.
Each letter in the message is shifted forward (encryption) or backward (decryption) by the specified key.
The transformed message is displayed as output.
